            <h1 class="topic_heading">WOMEN SAFETY</h1>
            <p class="topic_content">A recent WHO survey indicates that 35% of women globally, experience some form of
                abuse or physical violence. While this in itself is shocking, this figure would shoot up even further if
                unreported cases get reported. As law enforcement agencies strive to improve policing, a silent battle,
                in parallel, is also being fought on the digital turf by mobile applications and wearable devices to
                ensure women safety.
                Let us look at some examples on how technology plays a significant role to ensure women safety:

                Appalled by the growing incidents of crime against women, a Dutch start-up designed a wearable bracelet
                that sends out alerts to friends, family, as well as the police, during a crisis. The device uses a
                low-energy Bluetooth connection to sync to an app on the wearer's smartphone. The app lets the wearer
                decide who she wants to notify in case of an emergency - friends, family members, the police, or a group
                of users who agree to field emergency calls from other wearers. The app also uses the smartphone’s
                microphone to record the incident and subsequently transmits the wearer’s location along with the audio
                recording of the incident to the police.
                In another development, a group of students from North Carolina University in the US have invented a
                novel way of protecting women from sexual assault - a nail polish that detects the presence of drugs in
                a drink. The nail polish will empower any women to discreetly ensure her safety simply by stirring her
                drink with her finger. A change in colour of the nail polish indicates a spiked drink and this would
                help women to swiftly take preventive steps before a potential catastrophe.
                Everything you know about Women Safety is set to change.
                From hyperloops to self-driving cars, from ride-hailing to micro-mobility, from multimodal travel to
                flying taxis, we are in the process of completely reinventing how people move. And while we do know that
                everything is about to change, we still need to figure out how.
                This makes Women Safety one of the most exciting area in technology today. When you don't know what the
                future looks like, you have the power to invent it!

            <h1 class="topic_heading">STEAMPUNKS</h1>
            <p class="topic_content">Steampunk is a subgenre of science fiction, alternate history, and speculative
                fiction. Specifically, it involves an era or world where steam power is still widely used—usually the
                19th century and often Victorian era Britain—that incorporates prominent elements of either science
                fiction or fantasy. Works of steampunk often feature anachronistic technology or futuristic innovations
                as Victorians may have envisioned them; in other words, based on a Victorian perspective on fashion,
                culture, architectural style, art, etc. This technology may include such fictional machines as those
                found in the works of H. G. Wells and Jules Verne or real technologies like the computer but developed
                earlier in an alternate history. Other examples of steampunk contain alternative history-style
                presentations of "the path not taken" for such technology as lighter-than-air airships, analog
                computers, or such digital mechanical computers as Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace's Analytical engine.

            <h1 class="topic_heading">MEDICAL ISSUES</h1>
            <p class="topic_content">Although the level of technology in healthcare is at an all-time high, there is
                still immense potential to use technology to automate daily operative processes and tasks.
                Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) can revolutionize health-tech for the
                better and an effective way to determine this is to organize health-tech hackathons.
                Here are a few health-tech hackathon ideas:

            <ol style="margin-left:10px">
                <li>Data processing for hospitals</li>
                <li>Virtual health assistant</li>
                <li> Remote patient examination</li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <h1 class="topic_heading">TOURS & TRAVELS</h1>
            <p class="topic_content">Today, nobody doubts that technology and travel are the perfect combination. This
                joint force also plays a crucial role in the way we travel: from the vacation destination we choose, all
                the way to what we do once we're there and even in the time after we've come back from our adventure. It
                is so prevalent, that according to a Google Travel study, 74% of travelers plan their trips on the
                Internet, while only 13% still use travel agencies to prepare them.

                <h3 class="topic_heading"> Mobile Technology</h3>
                <p class="topic_content">This is undoubtedly the main character in the new ways of travel. The cell
                    phone has become our tour guide, travel agency, best restaurant locator, map, and more. It's by our
                    side during the entire purchase journey. In fact, according to TripAdvisor, 45% of users use their
                    smartphone for everything having to do with their vacations.</p>

                <h3 class="topic_heading">Augmented Reality </h3>
                <p class="topic_content">Augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR) have also entered the travel
                    world, and the truth is that it’s a trend due to all the possibilities they can offer. More and more
                    companies use it to show users a cabin on a cruise ship or transport them, for a few seconds, to the
                    Great Wall of China. </p>
                <h3 class="topic_heading"> Internet of Things (IoT) </h3>
                <p class="topic_content">The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to bring significant updates to the
                    tourism industry. They include integrating sensors connected to the Internet inside items like cars,
                    suitcases, buildings, and more.
                </p>
                <h3 class="topic_heading"> Virtual Assistants </h3>
                <p class="topic_content">We’re all familiar with Siri and Alexa, the virtual assistants that meet all
                    our needs: what’s the weather like today in my city, turn the radio on, open my email, and
                    more.Hotels are now starting to enlist this “help” thanks to the arrival of virtual assistants that
                    are specifically designed for this environment
